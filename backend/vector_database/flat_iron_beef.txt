Flat Iron: Beef Philosophy and The Flat Iron Herd

Understanding Good Beef:
Good beef quality is influenced by many factors: breed and genetics, rearing methods, diet (what it ate and when), climate, animal health, sex, age, handling, slaughtering process, aging, butchery, and cooking.

Flat Iron's Sourcing Approach:
We primarily serve beef raised in extensive or regenerative farming systems, typically sourced from small, family-run farms in the UK and Ireland. We favour traditional cattle breeds and prefer longer, slower rearing methods. This approach yields better marbling in the meat, resulting in enhanced juiciness and flavour in the steak.

Judging Beef Quality:
Our main criteria for judging beef are flavour, juiciness, and tenderness. We recognize that, like wine, there are many different styles of excellent beef. We appreciate variety, from tender and juicy steaks with subtle flavour to those that are rich and buttery, or even intense and almost overpowering. We avoid rigid definitions of what constitutes "good" beef (similar to avoiding dogma about wine needing specific aging or grape types).

The Flat Iron Herd:
Our passion extends beyond serving beef to understanding how to breed and raise the best cattle. In 2012, the same year Flat Iron was founded, we partnered with Charles Ashbridge, a third-generation beef farmer in Thirsk, Yorkshire. This collaboration allowed us to establish our own herd to experiment and learn.

Today, the Flat Iron herd consists of about 40 head. We focus on using rare and traditional breeds that lead longer, stress-free lives. A major focus in recent years has been rearing Wagyu, one of our preferred breeds. We are now proud to serve beef from our own suckler herd directly to our guests. The goal is continuously striving to produce the best possible beef.
