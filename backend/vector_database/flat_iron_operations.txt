The Flat Iron Herd Note:
Our Head of Beef selects meat directly from the source. Some comes from our own Flat Iron herd located near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, cared for by third-generation beef farmer Charles Ashbridge.

Optional Service Charge:
An optional 12.5% service charge is added to the bill. 100% of all tips (cash and card) are given directly to the staff.

The Flat Iron Fund:
Guests can donate an optional 10p per steak or special ordered. Flat Iron matches each donation with another 10p. All proceeds go to the Flat Iron Fund (Registered Charity Number: 1178402). More information can be found at flatironfund.org.

Souvenir Cleavers:
The small meat cleavers used at the table are essential for keeping steak prices accessible. Please leave them on the table. They are available for purchase at the restaurant for £15.
